\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
In this section, the impact assessment for all of the considered test cases from the previous section are developed. With this in mind, two assessments are conducted for each test case. 

Initially, a midpoint assessment is conducted to compare the impact of each note-taking scenario across various environmental mechanisms. This assessment is carried out both comparatively and in absolute terms, aiming to not only highlight the differences in impact between the approaches but also provide context regarding the significance of each category. For instance, while the digital scenario may exhibit a five-times greater impact in a specific category compared to the analog case, if the absolute value remains relatively small, it limits the extent of conclusions that can be drawn from this relationship. In this evaluation, all absolute values are expressed in units such as loss of species per year (species.yr), disability-adjusted life years (DALY), or excess costs in 2013 US Dollars. These units represent the damage to the ecosystem quality, damage to human health, and cost increases due to resource scarcity caused by the note-taking approach, respectively.

Following the midpoint assessment, an endpoint assessment is conducted to establish a single-score comparison between the approaches using normalization factors. This comparison step has a higher level of uncertainty compared to the previous assessment since it requires qualitative input to determine normalization factors across all categories. However, the well-established ReCiPe methodology used in this study provides objectivity to these values to the best of our knowledge.

\subsection{Manufacturing Impact}\label{subsec:results_manufacturing}
As mentioned in the previous section, first, the manufacturing processes for both note-taking approaches are compared. For this, the previously mentioned scenarios including their transportation and waste treatments are considered. 

As a first step, their effects per impact category were compared. Figure~\ref{fig:characterization_manufacturing} depicts a relative analysis for the most significant categories between both scenarios while Figure~\ref{fig:characterization_table_manufacturing} shows the absolute values for all impact categories.


\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Relative midpoint assessment for the manufacturing of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_manufacturing}
\end{figure}

This Figure showcases the similarity between the impact for both note-taking scenarios where each case dominates six categories. However, a clear disparity favoring the digital approach can be seen for all categories related with global warming and natural resources. The analog case causes about twice as much global warming on average over the three considered categories and is well above the digital case for scarcity of fossil resources, water consumption and ozone formation. On the other hand, the digital case has a much greater impact in categories involving the damaging of ecosystems such as terrestrial acidification and freshwater eutrophication as well as human impacts (carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic) and scarcity of mineral resources.

    \caption{Absolute midpoint assessment for the manufacturing of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_table_manufacturing}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:characterization_table_manufacturing}, the same trend is observed. Terrestrial ecotoxicity caused by the digital case is more than five times larger than for the analog case, whereas the land use for the analog case is an entire order of magnitude larger than the digital case. Nevertheless, these remaining categories are orders of magnitude smaller than the ones described in the previous Figure and must be carefully analyzed as to not allow for the attention to be deviated from the impact categories with the majority of the impact share. 

Once the midpoint assessment is conducted, the impact categories can be divided into three main groups based on the recipient for their impacts: the ecosystem, human health and the global resources. Figure~\ref{fig:damage_assessment_manufacturing} showcases a relative comparison per category between both note-taking scenarios.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Manufacturing/Damage_Assessment_Manufacturing.JPG}
    \caption{Relative endpoint assessment for the manufacturing of the investigated note-taking approaches.}\label{fig:damage_assessment_manufacturing}
\end{figure}

Based on these findings, it is apparent that both manufacturing processes exhibit a comparable impact on human health, with a slight advantage observed for the digital scenario. However, the analog scenario demonstrates approximately a 40\% greater impact on the ecosystem and global resources. This discovery is particularly unexpected, considering the significant manufacturing requirements and intercontinental transportation involved in the digital scenario.

Nevertheless, similar to the midpoint assessment, analyzing the absolute scores for each category is imperative for the context of this difference. Figure~\ref{fig:single_score_manufacturing} depicts the total single score given to the manufacturing for both note-taking scenarios alongside their internal distributions. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Manufacturing/Single_Score_Manufacturing.JPG}
    \caption{Single score distribution for the manufacturing of the investigated note-taking approaches.}\label{fig:single_score_manufacturing}
\end{figure}

From here, it becomes evident that the impact on human health is the major contributor for both scenarios, with the 40\% increase in ecosystem and resource impact for the analog scenario amounting to a surplus of an individual single score point. 

\subsection{Life Cycle Impact}\label{subsec:results_life_cycle}
Once the manufacturing for both note-taking scenarios was compared, the energy required to power the electronics from the digital case are taken into account. As mentioned earlier, three energy source scenarios are considered ranging from 0 to 100\% RES penetration for the grid mix. The results for their midpoint and endpoint assessment comparisons are seen in the following.

\subsubsection{0\% RES Penetration}
As expected, the impact for the digital case increases massively when the energy required to charge and operate the electronics is considered. Figures~\ref{fig:characterization_RES_0} and~\ref{fig:characterization_table_RES_0} showcase the midpoint assessment for both scenarios with 0\% RES penetration.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RES_0/Characterization_RES_0.JPG}
    \caption{Relative characterization for a 0\% RES penetration scenario of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_RES_0}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:characterization_RES_0} it becomes evident that the impact caused by the energy required to run the electronics causes for the digital case to far outweigh the impact for the analog case. The analog case represents no more than 20\% of the impact caused by the digital case across all categories, with most being below 15\%.

    \caption{caption}\label{fig:single_score_RES0}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{50\% RES Penetration}

The second energy source scenario depicts a 50\% RES penetration. Figure \ref*{fig:characterization_RES_50} shows the relative characterization for the two note-taking alternatives considered, while Figure \ref{fig:characterization_table_RES_50} depicts the categories considered. The results are similar to those presented in Section [CITE 0 RES SECTION], where clearly the analog alternative has a lower impact per category. Nevertheless, some categories have increased for the 50\% RES in comparison to the 0\% RES. For instance, the \textit{ozone formation for human health} category had an increase of around 6\%. Similarly, both \textit{global warming} categories considered present an increase of 10\%. On the other hand, \textit{water consumption} for human health and terrestrial ecosystems presented an impact reduction of 7\% and 9\%, respectively. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RES_50/Characterization_RES_50.JPG}
    \caption{Relative characterization for a 50\% RES penetration scenario of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_RES_50}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/RES_50/Characterization_Table_RES_50.PNG}
    \caption{Absolute characterization for a 50\% RES penetration scenario of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_table_RES_50}
\end{figure}

The relative comparison per impact category of the 50\% RES scenario for the note-taking methods is shown in Figure \ref{fig:damage_assessment_RES_50}. In contrast with the 0\% RES scenario, the \textit{ecosystems} and \textit{human health} impacts are lower for this case, with 6\% and 2\% reductions, respectively. However, the \textit{resources} category increased by 8\% for the 50\% RES scenario. This results may indicate that the impact in general can still be diminished by increasing the RES involvement to charge the digital note-taking option.  

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RES_50/Damage_Assessment_RES_50.JPG}
    \caption{Relative endpoint assessment of the investigated note-taking approaches for a 50\% RES.}\label{fig:damage_assessment_RES_50}
\end{figure}

Finally, the total single score given for the 50\% RES scenario is for both note-taking options is shown in Figure \ref{fig:single_score_RES50}. It can be observed that the \textit{human health} category has the biggest impact over the \textit{ecosystem} and \textit{resources} categories for the analog and digital note-taking approaches. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RES_50/Single_Score_RES_50.JPG}
    \caption{Single score distribution of the investigated note-taking approaches for a 50\% RES.}\label{fig:single_score_RES50}
\end{figure}

Comparing these findings to the relatively even results from the manufacturing comparison, it can be concluded that the main driving factor for the digital case's impact is its energy source. For this reason, scenarios with increasing RES shares are investigated in the following.

\subsubsection{100\% RES Penetration}

The last energy scenario consists of defining a 100\% RES penetration to charge the digital note-taking method, which means that all the energy comes from renewable sources. Figure \ref{fig:characterization_RES_100} shows the characterization for both note-taking methods, and Figure \ref{fig:characterization_table_RES_100} the relevant impact categories. Since now the energy sources are completely renewable, it would be logical to expect a lower impact in some categories from the digital alternative. In contrast to the 50\% RES, the \textit{ozone formation} for human health, and \textit{global warming} categories increased for the analog alternative. The \textit{ozone formation} increased 16\%, while the \textit{global warming} for terrestrial ecosystems and human health presented the largest change, with a 26\% and 28\% increase respectively. This means that the digital note-taking alternative contributes less to global warming than the analog option. On the other hand the \textit{water consumption} impact stayed relatively the same for the 100\% RES penetration scenario.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RES_100/Characterization_RES_100.JPG}
    \caption{Relative characterization for a 100\% RES penetration scenario of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_RES_100}
\end{figure}

    \caption{Absolute characterization for a 100\% RES penetration scenario of the investigated note-taking approaches per impact category.}\label{fig:characterization_table_RES_100}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:damage_assessment_RES_100} shows the endpoint assessment of 100\% RES scenario for the note-taking methods considered. The impact in \textit{human health} and \textit{resources} dropped 4\% in for the analog altertive if compared to the 50\% RES scenario. On the other hand, the ecosystem impact increased 19\% for the analog case, which means that the impact of the digital note-taking method is definitely lower with completely renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, the ecosystem of the digital alternative is still considerably higher than the analog option. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Relative endpoint assessment of the investigated note-taking approaches for a 50\% RES.}\label{fig:damage_assessment_RES_100}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:single_score_RES100} shows the total single score given for the 100\% RES energy scenario. As in the 50\% RES case, the \textit{human health} category has the most significant impact in both categories. Following the tren from the previous studies, it can be concluded that regardless of how much renewable sources of energy are used, the analog note-taking alternative will have a less impact than the digital option.
