\section{Life Cycle Scenarios}\label{sec:scenarios}
Following the definition for both scenarios to be compared, their life cycles must be described. For this, all materials and processes involved in their material sourcing, processing, manufacturing, assembling, transportation, use and disposal are considered. This was done within \textsc{SimaPro}, with the help of the EcoInvent database. Subsections~\ref{subsec:analog_scenario} and~\ref{subsec:digital_scenario} describe each step for the analog and digital scenarios to be compared, respectively. Moreover, subsection~\ref{subsec:case_studies} describes all of the considered case studies for the simulations.

\subsection{Case Studies}\label{subsec:case_studies}

\subsubsection*{Manufacturing}
The first case study considers the environmental impacts of manufacturing an iPad and Apple pencil compared to a paper notebook and a pen. It is important to mention that this study does not take into account the energy needed to charge an iPad. Moreover in the following case studies, different energy scenarios are considered and further discussed. 

To manufacture an iPad, the aluminum body, circuit board, and battery must be produced and assembled. This involves the use of considerable amounts of water, chemicals, and energy, which contribute to air, water and soil pollution. For the production of an Apple pencil, the process is similar, except for the body of the pencil, which is made from injection moulding of plastic. 

In order to manufacture a paper notebook, wood pulp is used to create the paper. It is well known that the production paper also needs large mounts of water and energy, however, chemicals such as dyes and bleaches are also encountered in the manufacturing process. The production of a pen also involves the use of chemical substances such as the ink and solvent, and to manufacture the barrel, plastic injection moulding is used.
